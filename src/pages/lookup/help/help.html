  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <p>
    Choose a location and a date. By default these are set for your current location
    and today's date 10 years back in time. Tap the "Lookup" button when you are done.
    The app will check the chosen date and location for each year as from the year you
    choose up until 2016. The result will be shown on a new page.
  </p>
  <h2>Advanced options</h2>
  <p>
    Adjust the slider to choose the amount of daily precipitation (0-10 millimeters).
    The app will only consider a day as rainy if the chosen amount of rain (or more)
    has fallen during that whole day.

    This might be something you want to set to potentially get a more
    representative result. Often it is enough to set the slider to "1mm".

    This is however completely optional and by default it is set for 0 millimeters.

    Tap the "Done" button when you are done, otherwise the app won't save this setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Worth noting</strong><br />
    This option is only available for lookups 10 years or less back in time.
    This is because the really old weather data often is to insufficient
    to calculate the daily precipitation.
